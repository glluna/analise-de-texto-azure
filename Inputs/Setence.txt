Outdated hotel with slow service
Grand Palace Hotel, Paris, France
12/3/2019

This is an old hotel (built in the 1960s) with basic furnishings—showing signs of wear and tear. The customer service was slow, and I had to wait over an hour to check in. The Wi-Fi was unreliable, forcing me to go to a nearby café for internet access. The website claims it's near the Eiffel Tower, but in reality, it's quite a long walk.
